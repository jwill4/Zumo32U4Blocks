# ZumoBlocks
Repository for Blocklyduino code used to create new blocks for Polulu robot (Zumo32U4)
I am a secondary teacher in Australia developing an environment for my year 10 students that will encourage them to code.
I have a couple of Zumo 32U4 robots from Polulu.  They are Arduino based.
As a starting point i am making Blocklyduino blocks for the Zumo bots so the students can quickly get into moving the bots around.
I have created this repository so i can get feedback on some of the issues im having with hte blocks.
